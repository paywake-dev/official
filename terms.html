        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>Welcome to our program that allows you to create disincentives for failing to wake up and receive incentives for waking up at a predetermined time (the &ldquo;<b>Program</b>&rdquo;).&nbsp; This agreement (&ldquo;<b>Agreement</b>&rdquo;) governs your use of the Program through Paywake.net and related mobile and software applications (&ldquo;<b>Company Properties</b>&rdquo;) and your relationship with us, Paywake Corporation (&ldquo;<b>Paywake</b>&rdquo;).&nbsp; By using our service, you agree on behalf of yourself and any others who use the Program or Company Properties under your account, to the following conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Description of the Program</p>
        <p>The Program allows users to create an incentive for waking up by agreeing to forfeit a predetermined amount of US dollars that they choose (the &ldquo;<b>Amount</b>&rdquo;) if they fail to take certain actions to verify they are awake at a certain predetermined date and time (such time, the &ldquo;<b>Wakeup Time</b>&rdquo;).&nbsp; If a user verifies they are awake at the Wakeup Time, they do not forfeit the Amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition, users who verify they are awake at the Wakeup Time are eligible to receive a portion (the &ldquo;<b>Incentive Portion</b>&rdquo;) of the amounts forfeited by other users (if any) who did not verify they were awake at the Wakeup Time.&nbsp; The Calculation of the Incentive Portion is described below.</p>
        <p>The Program is limited to those dates and times (the &ldquo;<b>Available Times</b>&rdquo;) and amounts that we make available via the Company Properties.&nbsp; Any time at least one user participates in the Program for an Available Time, that instance of the Program is referred to as a &ldquo;<b>Wakeup</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any time you participate in the Program or a Wakeup, the rules in these terms and conditions apply.</p>
        <p class="heading">Program Rules</p>
        <p class="subheading">Eligibility</p>
        <p>You must be over 18 years old and reside in the United States.&nbsp; Residents of Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and WA are not permitted.</p>
        <p>You must provide us with an email address, your address in the United States, and other information we may reasonably request to verify your identity and eligibility.</p>
        <p>A valid US-bank account associated with your name that is able to receive ACH payments.</p>
        <p>You must have a valid user account with Paywake.net (&ldquo;<b>Account</b>&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>You may not be an employee of Paywake or a family member of any employee of Paywake.</p>
        <p>This program and your participation is void where prohibited (including where registration with any state regulator is required).</p>
        <p class="subheading">Enrollment and Entry</p>
        <p>To participate in the Program and a Wakeup, you must select an Available Time from the Paywake.net dashboard in your account.&nbsp; Once you select an Available Time, you will be prompted to enter an amount that you agree to forfeit if you do not verify you are awake at the Wakeup Time. You must agree to an Amount of at least $5 to enter the Wakeup.&nbsp; We may impose a maximum amount that you are able to forfeit for any Wakeup at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You may only enroll in one Wakeup in any 19-hour period.&nbsp; You must enroll in a Wakeup at least three hours and 1 minute before the applicable Available Time.&nbsp; For example, if you would like to enroll in a Wakeup for 7:00AM on Monday, January 31, you must enroll in the Wakeup by 3:59AM on Monday, January 1.&nbsp; Continuing with this example, once you enroll in a Wakeup for 7:00AM on Monday, January 31, you may not participate in another Wakeup until 2:00AM on Tuesday, February 1.</p>
        <p>You may only enroll in two Wakeups in a 24-hour period, regardless of when the Wakeups will take place.</p>
        <p>Once you enroll in a Wakeup by choosing a Wakeup Time and Amount and we confirm your enrollment, you may not remove yourself from the Wakeup and the Amount will be available to other users in the calculation of the Incentive Portion following the Wakeup.</p>
        <p>You will only be enrolled into a Wakeup if you receive a confirmation message via the Company Properties and a confirmation email to the email address we have on file in your Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We may cancel a Wakeup for any reason with notice to its participants.&nbsp; If for any reason we must cancel a Wakeup, no participant will be required to forfeit their Amount for that Wakeup subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement regarding Fraud and Abuse.</p>
        <p>We may deny enrollment into any Wakeup or remove a user from a Wakeup if we suspect you of abusing these rules and terms and conditions or posing a risk to the security of our customers or the Company Properties.&nbsp; If we remove a user from a Wakeup, subject to any express exceptions in these terms and conditions, they will not be required to forfeit their Amount.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Verification you are Awake</p>
        <p>In order to verify you are awake for any Wakeup and to be eligible to receive your Amount and any Incentive Amount, you will be asked to take certain actions that will be described in advance of entering the Wakeup. For example, you may be asked to take photos using your camera phone of up to 10 items commonly found in a home, such as a door handle, tooth brush, trash can, or clothing hanger and transmit them to Paywake for verification.&nbsp; You may be asked to take additional steps to verify you took these actions and did not enlist some other person or process to subvert the intent of the Wakeup.&nbsp; Only once Paywake verifies that you took photos of those items will you be eligible to receive the Amount and any Incentive Portion.&nbsp; You are responsible for ensuring you have at least the items listed above and those listed in advance of entering the Wakeup to verify that you were awake for the Wakeup.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for confirming your phone and internet connection are sufficient for this purpose and Paywake will not be responsible for any failed verification due to externalities beyond our control.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Calculation of Incentive Portion</p>
        <p>Except for a 15% service fee payable to Paywake, all amounts forfeited by users in a given Wakeup (the &ldquo;<b>Total Incentive Package</b>&rdquo;) will be divided among the users who verified they were awake at the Wakeup Time (each a &ldquo;<b>Successful Waker</b>&rdquo;).&nbsp; The Total Incentive Package will be divided in proportion to the amount each Successful Waker agreed to forfeit out of all of the amounts each Successful Waker agreed to forfeit.&nbsp; For example, if there are two Successful Wakers for a certain Wakeup, and one agreed to forfeit $40 and the other agreed to forfeit $60, the Successful Waker who agreed to forfeit $40 would receive 40% of the Total Incentive Package because they agreed to forfeit an amount that is 40% of the Total Incentive Package.</p>
        <p>Because the amount of the Incentive Portion, if any, depends on the sum of Amounts forfeited for a given Wakeup and the number of Successful Wakers, we will determine the Successful Wakers no later than 72 hours after the applicable Wakeup, and we will determine the amount of any Incentive Portion no later than 7 days following any such Wakeup.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Payments</p>
        <p>Payment of the Incentive Portion will be made using the ACH credit feature available on our website. Payments will be made quarterly on the following dates: January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1.</p>
        <p>It is your responsibility to check your user account regularly to ensure that your account balance and bank account details are accurate. If you believe that an amount has not been properly credited to your account, you must contact support@paywake.net within ninety (90) days of the applicable Wakeup. In addition, the Company may make account adjustments, in its sole discretion, deems as fraudulent, abusive, unethical, suspicious or otherwise inconsistent with these terms and conditions or any other applicable law or regulation. Our decisions are final. Should you disagree with any adjustments made to your account or payments made to you, your sole remedy is to withdraw from the Program.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Taxes</p>
        <p>You may be taxed on your receipt of the Incentive Portion and other considerations depending on the tax laws of federal, state and local jurisdictions. You will be solely responsible for any and all tax liability arising out of the consideration received in connection with your participation in the Program.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Program Restrictions</p>
        <p>You agree that you will not, and will not permit others to: (i) damage, interfere with or overload the Program or the Company Properties; (ii) introduce into the Program or or the Company Properties any code intended to disrupt the Program; (iii) alter or delete any information, data, text, links, images, and other content available through the Program (collectively, &ldquo;<b>Content</b>&rdquo;); (iv) access the Program or the Company Properties by expert system, electronic agent, &ldquo;bot&rdquo; or other automated means; (v) use scripts or disguised redirects to derive financial benefit from the Company Properties; (vi) modify, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, decompile, copy or otherwise derive the source code of the Company Properties, for any reason; (vii) provide any unauthorized third party with access to the Program; (viii) access or attempt to access confidential Content through the Company Properties; (ix) interfere with the operation of the Program;or&nbsp; (x) engage in any activity that does not comply with applicable law and regulations or otherwise engage in any illegal, manipulative or misleading activity through the use of the Program.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Your Account</p>
        <p>You agree to keep your account information complete, current, and accurate by periodically updating the information through the Company Properties. You will maintain the confidentiality of your username and password which you use to access the Program. Any use of your username and password will be deemed to be your use, and we are entitled to act on instructions received under your password and we are not responsible for any actions taken by someone else who uses your password. If there is a breach of security through your account, you will immediately change your password and notify us of such breach. You agree that, unless you have first notified us immediately of any such breach, we should assume that any instruction transmitted using your username and password is yours and has been authorized by you, and we will have no obligation to inquire into the propriety of such instruction.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Fraudulent Activity</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to investigate any interaction with any Company Property that we believe is abusing or has abused the Program. We reserve the right to rescind any Amount or Incentive Portion that we believe, in our sole discretion, is abusing or has abused the Program, including, without limitation, by not personally verifying you are awake or by creating multiple accounts to circumvent our limitations on entering Wakeups or setting Amounts. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, any fraud or abuse relating to Incentive Portions, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to Paywake by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your Account and forfeiture of any accrued Incentive Portions. If Paywake has any reason to suspect fraudulent activity is associated with your Account, Paywake reserves the right to delay or withhold payment of any Incentive Portion and/or refer you for criminal or civil investigation by the relevant authorities. Any suspected or actual cases of fraud activity will be escalated and reviewed in accordance with our fraud process. Our decisions are final.</p>
        <p class="heading">Intellectual Property</p>
        <p class="subheading">Program License</p>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these terms, Paywake grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Program. All rights not expressly granted to you in these terms and conditions are reserved and retained by Paywake or its licensors or other content providers. No part of the Company Properties may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express written consent. The licenses granted by us&nbsp; terminate if you do not comply with these terms and conditions.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Feedback</p>

You hereby grant to Paywake and its agents a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and display the Feedback in any media and for any legal purpose, including, without limitation, the right to use such Feedback in advertising and promotional materials and to enhance or improve our products and services and the products and services of its affiliates.</p>

        <p class="heading">Disputes and Liability</p>
        <p class="subheading">Indemnification</p>
        <p>You agree to indemnify Paywake, as well as our respective officers, directors, employees, successors, agents and affiliates, for any and all claims, damages, losses and causes of action (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to your breach of this Agreement. You agree to cooperate as fully as reasonably required in our defense and/or settlement of any claim. We reserve the right, in our reasonable discretion, to assume exclusive control over the defense and settlement of any matter subject to indemnification by you.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Disputes</p>
        <p class="subsubheading">Informal Dispute Resolution</p>

        <p class="subsubheading">Arbitration</p>
        <p>You agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these terms, the Program, or the Company Properties. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Paywake&rsquo;s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Paywake. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
        <p>All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim will be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shwill all also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration.

        <p class="subheading">CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND PAYWAKE ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</p>
        <p>This means that neither you nor Paywake can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person&rsquo;s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and Paywake further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the &ldquo;Class Action Waiver,&rdquo; are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.</p>
        <p class="subheading">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
        <p>THE PROGRAM AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE COMPANY PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED BY PAYWAKE ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. PAYWAKE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE COMPANY PROPERTIES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE COMPANY PROPERTIES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>

You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Applicable Law</p>
        <p>By using any Company Property, you agree that applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Oregon, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these terms and conditions and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Paywake.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Termination</p>
        <p>This Agreement is effective when accepted by you and will remain in effect until you or we terminate your membership in the Program. We may terminate this Agreement and your use of the Program at any time, for any reason or no reason.
