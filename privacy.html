        <p>Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through Paywake Corporation and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Mode and place of processing the Data&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subsubheading">Methods of processing&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.&nbsp;</p>

Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (&ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

        <p>&mdash;&emsp;Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.&nbsp;</p>
